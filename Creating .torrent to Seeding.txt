This is an example of a complete description and should be what you're aiming for:[url=http://ultimategamer.club/torrents-details.php?id=2448]Vernon's Legacy[/url]. If you can't complete this, that's ok, just do the best you can.

7. Upload torrent. 

8. After the torrent has been uploaded, you have to delete the .torrent file you made in your client. Then you must re-download the torrent from UGC. This will add your personal passkey to the torrent. You then have to recheck the file, then you have successfully uploaded a torrent.
